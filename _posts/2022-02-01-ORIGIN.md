The aim of this project was to continue to improve my hardware and software design skills by creating a device I would use daily. Of all devices I use on a daily basis, the keyboard likely ranks the highest for hourly usage. 

The first thing i did was research interesting/unique ideas applied to keyboards, one of the first things I found was related to turning a binary keypress into an analog one. [Brian Benchoff](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/26/adding-analog-touch-to-nearly-any-mechanical-keyboard/)

I"B<p>During my year in industry at Huawei, it dawned on me how little practical experience I had on engineering projects. I’ve always been into tech and being creative, yet I hadn’t ever taken the dive into trying to build something from scratch. I started by surrounding everything I saw online with other engineers and creators to help inspire ideas. Months went past with me silently browsing and finding new creators, when I found a post by <a href="https://gregdavill.com/blog/2020/6/13/miniature-3456x-led-cube">Greg Davill</a>. This colourful cube was exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. It was flashy and “simple enough” to get started. I realised early on that playing with FPGAs was probably a bit too much for a first time project so I looked into ways of working with microcontrollers. I also wanted to miniaturise what he had done. So I looked around and found other projects of a similar theme. When I found Pol Pla’s paper on <a href="https://dam-prod.media.mit.edu/x/files/sites/default/files/TEI_DisplayBlocks_CameraReady_lite.pdf">Display Blocks</a>.</p>

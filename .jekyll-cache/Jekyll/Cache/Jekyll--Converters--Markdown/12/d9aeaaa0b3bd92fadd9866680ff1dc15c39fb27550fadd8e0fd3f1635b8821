I"î<p>Hey! My name is Benjamin Anderson, Iâ€™m an aspiring Hardware Engineer looking to develop skills in everything that allows me to build anything my mind can come up with. I enjoy the process of moulding the ideas in my head into something tangible, and then fine tuning it until its exactly what I envisioned. Whether itâ€™s the PCBs controlling a new device I want to create, the blender renders for project thumbnails, or even the css files that make up the formatting of this website.</p>

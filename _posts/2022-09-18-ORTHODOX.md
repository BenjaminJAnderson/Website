## **Introduction**

In this post, I'll be sharing the journey of building my custom ortholinear keyboard. From initial design to final assembly, I will walk you through each step of the process.

I wanted to do something different by incorporating **analog switches** for the **WASD and arrow keys**. This allows for more precise control, making the keyboard ideal for gaming and other applications requiring nuanced input. Additionally, I've included **quarter-size switches** that fit four buttons into a single key cap. These coloUr-coordinated buttons act as another version of the shift key, allowing for many more characters to be incorporated into a single keyboard. This innovative approach significantly expands the functionality and versatility of the keyboard, whilst giving a custom flare that separates it from off the shelf, hence the name UNORTHODOX.

## **Why Ortholinear?**

The decision to build an ortholinear keyboard stems from both aesthetic and functional considerations. Ortholinear keyboards feature a grid-like layout where keys are aligned in straight columns and rows, creating a clean and simple look. This simplicity in design not only makes the keyboard visually appealing but also streamlines the process of arranging the circuit board.

### **Simplicity and Efficiency**

The uniform arrangement of keys in an ortholinear keyboard simplifies the design and manufacturing process. With keys neatly aligned in a grid, designing the PCB (printed circuit board) becomes more straightforward, as the traces and connections can follow a logical and organized pattern. This can reduce the complexity of the circuit design and potentially lower production costs. Moreover, the consistent alignment of keys can improve typing accuracy and speed for some users, as fingers move in a more natural, linear fashion.

### **Historical Context**

To understand the appeal of the ortholinear layout, it's useful to look back at the history of keyboard design. The staggered layout of traditional keyboards dates back to the era of mechanical typewriters. In early typewriters, the keys were arranged in a staggered pattern to prevent the levers from jamming together when typing quickly. This design was a practical solution to a mechanical problem.

### **Modern Relevance**

However, with the advent of electronic keyboards, the staggered layout no longer serves a functional purpose. Modern keyboards do not have the same mechanical constraints, and the staggered arrangement persists largely out of convention rather than necessity. As a result, the ortholinear layout presents an opportunity to reimagine keyboard design without being bound by outdated mechanical requirements.

In summary, the ortholinear layout offers a sleek, efficient, and historically informed alternative to the traditional staggered keyboard design. By embracing this modern approach, we can create keyboards that are not only more visually appealing but also potentially more ergonomic and easier to manufacture.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I opted to use **KICAD** for designing the motherboard and **OpenSCAD** for creating custom keycaps. Both of these tools offer robust features and flexibility, making them ideal for my custom ortholinear keyboard build.

### **KICAD for Motherboard Design**

KICAD is a powerful, open-source electronic design automation (EDA) software suite that I chose for designing the keyboard's PCB (printed circuit board). Its comprehensive set of tools allows for intricate and precise design, making it perfect for handling the unique layout and requirements of an ortholinear keyboard. 

Using KICAD, I was able to:

- **Schematic Capture**: Create detailed and organized schematic diagrams that represent the electrical connections between components.
- **PCB Layout**: Design the physical layout of the PCB with precision, ensuring that all components are placed optimally and that the electrical traces are routed efficiently.
- **3D Visualization**: Preview the design in 3D to get a better understanding of how the final product will look and to check for any potential issues with component placement or interference.
- **Gerber File Generation**: Produce the necessary files for manufacturing the PCB, ensuring that everything is ready for fabrication.

### **OpenSCAD for Custom Keycaps**

For creating custom keycaps, I chose **OpenSCAD**, a script-based 3D CAD modeler. OpenSCAD is particularly well-suited for parametric design, allowing for precise control over the dimensions and features of the keycaps.

With OpenSCAD, I was able to:

- **Custom Shapes**: Design keycaps with specific shapes and profiles that fit the quarter-size switches, enabling the innovative 4-buttons-in-one-keycap feature.
- **Parametric Design**: Adjust dimensions and features quickly by changing parameters in the script, streamlining the process of tweaking and perfecting the keycaps.
- **3D Printing**: Generate STL files for 3D printing, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration to ensure the keycaps fit perfectly and function as intended.

By using OpenSCAD, I could achieve a high level of customization and precision, creating keycaps that not only meet the functional requirements of the keyboard but also enhance its aesthetic appeal.


## **Design and Development Process**

### Schematic Design

The heart of any custom keyboard project lies in the design of its PCB (printed circuit board). Below is the schematic diagram of my custom ortholinear keyboard, designed using KICAD.


![Initial Design Sketch]({{site.baseurl}}/images/keyboardmotherboard.webp)

The schematic can be broken down into several key sections:

#### Microcontroller Unit (MCU)

At the core of the design is the **ATmega32U4** microcontroller (U1), which serves as the brain of the keyboard. This microcontroller is chosen for its compatibility with USB HID (Human Interface Device) and its ability to handle multiple input/output operations. Key connections include:
- **Power Pins**: VCC, AVCC, and GND are connected to ensure the MCU is properly powered.
- **Reset**: A reset circuit is included to restart the MCU when needed.
- **Crystal Oscillator**: The XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins are connected to a crystal oscillator (Y1) and capacitors (C2, C3) to provide the necessary clock signal for the MCU's operation.
- **USB Data Lines**: The D+ and D- lines are connected through resistors (R3, R4) for proper USB communication.

#### USB Connection

The USB interface (J1) is crucial for connecting the keyboard to a computer. This section includes:
- **USB Type-C Receptacle**: The schematic shows a USB Type-C connector (X1) wired for USB 2.0 functionality.
- **Power Lines**: VBUS and GND provide power from the USB connection.
- **Data Lines**: The D+ and D- lines are routed to the MCU for data transmission.

#### Key Matrix

The key matrix configuration is a crucial part of the schematic:
- **Rows and Columns**: The MCU's GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins are connected to the rows (ROW0, ROW1, ROW2, ROW3) and columns (COL0, COL1, COL2, etc.) of the key matrix.
- **Pull-up Resistors**: Internal or external pull-up resistors are used on the rows or columns to ensure reliable key press detection.

## PCB Design

The PCB design for the ORTHODOX keyboard was a critical part of the project, focusing on integrating the Kailh Choc low-profile keyswitches and implementing a novel method for measuring analog keypresses. This section outlines the key components and techniques used in the PCB design process.

### Kailh Choc Low-Profile Keyswitches

For this keyboard, I selected the Kailh Choc low-profile keyswitches due to their slim design and reliable performance. These switches are ideal for creating a compact and sleek keyboard while maintaining the tactile feel that many users appreciate.

- **Slim Design**: The low-profile nature of the Kailh Choc switches allows for a thinner keyboard, making it more portable and aesthetically pleasing.
- **Durability**: Known for their durability, these switches ensure a long lifespan for the keyboard, even with extensive use.
- **Ease of Integration**: The switches are designed to fit easily into a custom PCB layout, simplifying the design and manufacturing process.

### Analog Keypress Measurement

To achieve precise analog keypress measurement, I incorporated copper coil traces around each keyswitch on the PCB. This innovative approach leverages the properties of the metal springs in the switches and the LDC1614 from Texas Instruments.

- **Copper Coil Traces**: Each keyswitch is surrounded by a copper coil trace on the PCB. These traces act as inductive sensors that can detect changes in the magnetic field caused by the metal spring inside the switch.
- **Inductive Sensing**: When a key is pressed, the metal spring's position changes, which in turn affects the inductance of the coil. The LDC1614 inductance-to-digital converter (LDC) from Texas Instruments measures these changes in inductance.
- **LDC1614 Integration**: The LDC1614 is a high-precision inductive sensor that converts the analog signals from the coils into digital data. This data is then processed to determine the exact position of the keypress, allowing for nuanced and precise control.
- **Analog Keypress Detection**: This method of measuring analog keypresses provides more detailed input data compared to traditional digital switches. It enables features like variable key sensitivity and enhanced gaming controls, where the pressure and depth of key presses can be crucial.

### Design Process

The PCB design process involved several key steps to integrate these components effectively:

- **Schematic Capture**: Using KICAD, I created detailed schematic diagrams to map out the connections between the Kailh Choc switches, copper coils, and the LDC1614.
- **PCB Layout**: The layout was carefully planned to ensure that the copper coils were positioned correctly around each switch and that the traces were optimized for signal integrity.
- **3D Visualization**: KICAD's 3D visualization tools helped ensure that all components would fit together as intended, and that there were no interference issues.
- **Gerber File Generation**: Once the design was finalized, I generated the necessary Gerber files for PCB fabrication. These files include all the information needed for manufacturing the PCB.

### Manufacturing and Testing

After designing the PCB, I proceeded with the manufacturing and testing phases:

- **Prototyping**: Initial prototypes were manufactured to test the fit and function of the PCB. This phase involved checking the alignment of the switches, the accuracy of the inductive sensing, and the overall performance of the board.
- **Testing**: Extensive testing was conducted to fine-tune the analog keypress measurement system. This included calibrating the LDC1614 and ensuring that the inductive sensing provided accurate and reliable data.

By combining the Kailh Choc low-profile switches with the innovative use of copper coil traces and the LDC1614, the PCB design for the ORTHODOX keyboard achieves both a sleek form factor and advanced functionality. This approach not only enhances the typing experience but also opens up new possibilities for gaming and other applications requiring precise input control.


### Case Design

The case design of the ORTHODOX keyboard is a critical aspect that not only houses the components but also enhances the overall aesthetic and functionality of the device. For this project, I utilized **OpenSCAD** to parametrically design the key switches and **FreeCAD** to create the outer case that encloses the battery and PCB.

### Parametric Design with OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD, a script-based 3D CAD modeler, was instrumental in designing the key switches. The parametric design capabilities of OpenSCAD allowed me to define parameters such as key dimensions, spacing, and profiles, which made it easy to iterate and refine the design.

- **Precision and Customization**: By defining parameters in the script, I could easily adjust the size and shape of the key switches. This was particularly useful for creating the quarter-size switches that integrate four buttons into a single keycap, enhancing the keyboard’s functionality.

### Creating the Outer Case with FreeCAD

For the outer case, I chose **FreeCAD** due to its robust features and support for complex geometries. FreeCAD provided the necessary tools to design a sleek and functional enclosure that securely houses the keyboard’s PCB and battery.

- **Detailed Design**: FreeCAD allowed for precise modeling of the outer case. I could design intricate features such as mounting points, cable channels, and ventilation slots to ensure proper assembly and functionality.
- **Enclosing the Components**: The design included specific compartments for the PCB and battery. By accurately modeling these components in FreeCAD, I could ensure that they fit snugly within the case, preventing any movement that could lead to damage or connectivity issues.
- **Parametric Features**: Similar to OpenSCAD, FreeCAD supports parametric design, enabling adjustments to the case dimensions and features without starting from scratch. This flexibility was crucial in refining the case design to accommodate any changes in the PCB layout or battery size.
- **3D Printing and Machining**: The final case design was exported as STL files for 3D printing and CAD files for CNC machining. This dual approach allowed me to choose the best manufacturing method based on material preferences and production needs.

### Material Selection and Manufacturing

The case was 3D printed using a durable PLA filament, chosen for its strength and ease of printing. For the final version, I considered using aluminum or acrylic to enhance durability and aesthetics.

- **Prototyping**: Initial prototypes were 3D printed to test the fit and functionality of the case design. These prototypes helped identify any necessary adjustments to the design, ensuring that the final product would meet the desired specifications.

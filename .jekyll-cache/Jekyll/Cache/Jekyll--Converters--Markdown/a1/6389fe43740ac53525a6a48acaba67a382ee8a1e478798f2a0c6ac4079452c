I"<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to my blog! In this post, I’ll be sharing the journey of building my custom ortholinear keyboard. From initial design to final assembly, I will walk you through each step of the process.</p>

<p>I wanted to do something different by incorporating <strong>analog switches</strong> for the <strong>WASD and arrow keys</strong>. This allows for more precise control, making the keyboard ideal for gaming and other applications requiring nuanced input. Additionally, I’ve included <strong>quarter-size switches</strong> that fit four buttons into a single keycap. These color-coordinated buttons act as another version of the shift key, allowing for many more characters to be incorporated into a single keyboard. This innovative approach significantly expands the functionality and versatility of the keyboard, whilst giving a custom flare that seperates it from off the shelf, hence the name UNORTHODOX.</p>

<p>Follow along as I take you through the entire process of bringing this unique keyboard to life!</p>

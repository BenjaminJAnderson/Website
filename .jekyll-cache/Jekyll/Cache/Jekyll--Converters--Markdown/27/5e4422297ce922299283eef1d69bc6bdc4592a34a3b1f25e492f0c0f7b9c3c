<p>Welcome to my blog! In this post, Iâ€™ll be sharing the journey of building my custom ortholinear keyboard. From initial design to final assembly, I will walk you through each step of the process.</p>

<p>I wanted to do something different by incorporating <strong>analog switches</strong> for the <strong>WASD and arrow keys</strong>. This allows for more precise control, making the keyboard ideal for gaming and other applications requiring nuanced input. Additionally, Iâ€™ve included <strong>quarter-size switches</strong> that fit four buttons into a single key cap. These coloUr-coordinated buttons act as another version of the shift key, allowing for many more characters to be incorporated into a single keyboard. This innovative approach significantly expands the functionality and versatility of the keyboard, whilst giving a custom flare that separates it from off the shelf, hence the name UNORTHODOX.</p>

<h2 id="why-ortholinear">Why Ortholinear?</h2>

<p>The decision to build an ortholinear keyboard stems from both aesthetic and functional considerations. Ortholinear keyboards feature a grid-like layout where keys are aligned in straight columns and rows, creating a clean and simple look. This simplicity in design not only makes the keyboard visually appealing but also streamlines the process of arranging the circuit board.</p>

<h3 id="simplicity-and-efficiency">Simplicity and Efficiency</h3>

<p>The uniform arrangement of keys in an ortholinear keyboard simplifies the design and manufacturing process. With keys neatly aligned in a grid, designing the PCB (printed circuit board) becomes more straightforward, as the traces and connections can follow a logical and organized pattern. This can reduce the complexity of the circuit design and potentially lower production costs. Moreover, the consistent alignment of keys can improve typing accuracy and speed for some users, as fingers move in a more natural, linear fashion.</p>

<h3 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h3>

<p>To understand the appeal of the ortholinear layout, itâ€™s useful to look back at the history of keyboard design. The staggered layout of traditional keyboards dates back to the era of mechanical typewriters. In early typewriters, the keys were arranged in a staggered pattern to prevent the levers from jamming together when typing quickly. This design was a practical solution to a mechanical problem.</p>

<h3 id="modern-relevance">Modern Relevance</h3>

<p>However, with the advent of electronic keyboards, the staggered layout no longer serves a functional purpose. Modern keyboards do not have the same mechanical constraints, and the staggered arrangement persists largely out of convention rather than necessity. As a result, the ortholinear layout presents an opportunity to reimagine keyboard design without being bound by outdated mechanical requirements.</p>

<p>In summary, the ortholinear layout offers a sleek, efficient, and historically informed alternative to the traditional staggered keyboard design. By embracing this modern approach, we can create keyboards that are not only more visually appealing but also potentially more ergonomic and easier to manufacture.</p>

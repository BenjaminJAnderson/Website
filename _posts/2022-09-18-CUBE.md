During my year in industry at Huawei, it dawned on me how little practical experience I had on engineering projects. I've always been into tech and being creative, yet I hadn't ever taken the dive into trying to build something from scratch. I started by surrounding everything I saw online with other engineers and creators to help inspire ideas. Months went past with me silently browsing and finding new creators, when I found a post by [Greg Davill](https://gregdavill.com/blog/2020/6/13/miniature-3456x-led-cube). This colourful cube was exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. It was flashy and "simple enough" to get started. I realised early on that playing with FPGAs was probably a bit too much for a first time project so I looked into ways of working with microcontrollers. I also wanted to miniaturise what he had done. So I looked around and found other projects of a similar theme. When I found Pol Pla's paper on [Display Blocks](https://dam-prod.media.mit.edu/x/files/sites/default/files/TEI_DisplayBlocks_CameraReady_lite.pdf). 

>Display Blocks are designed to be a series of handheld
devices, enabling easy manipulation. Holding a device in
their hands, users are able to easily rotate it and reveal its
different sides. Thus, creating a self-enclosed, autonomous
device was crucial to offering unencumbered exploration of
content. The final design supports not only single device
manipulation but also holding multiple devices at once. For
this purpose, the devices must be easy to manipulate using
only one hand; this way, users can compare cubes side by side, adding even more richness to the navigation of data.

After reading this, I knew this was the project I had to work on, no matter how difficult it might be. Not only would it be a great engineering challenge, but it provided a tangible and satisfying object at the end of it..

## Circuit Design

A fully assembled cube uses 6 PCBs. The first PCB is the motherboard, containing all the necessary circuitry for voltage regulation, SPI comms and passive components for the different chips:
1. SSD1351 (128x128 RGB OLED Display IC)
2. [ICM20602](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/icm-20602/) (Inertial Measurement Unit)
3. [ESP32-S2-Mini-1U](https://www.espressif.com/en/producttype/esp32-s2-mini-1u) (Microcontroller)

The other 5 PCBs have almost identical schematics, providing the passive components and connectors for the displays. These displays will all be daisy chained together with the motherboard to provide a 6 display device.



## Frame Design
I initially designed the frame in unison with the

## Software Design

## Final Notes
[Cube Repository](https://github.com/BenjaminJAnderson/CUBE)

Details were sparse as to the actual circuitry and design of the 3D printed enclosure, so I assembled a rough BOM for the project using readily available hardware.

1. 4DOLED-282815 (128x128 RGB OLED Display)
2. ICM20602 (Inertial Measurement Unit)
3. ESP32-S2-Mini-1U (Microcontroller)
4. Battery

The hardest part about the project was using Fusion360 and KiCAD in tandem with eachother. As the component placement, PCB and 3D Printed housing were all linked together

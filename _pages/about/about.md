Hey! My name is Benjamin Anderson, I'm an aspiring Hardware Engineer looking to develop skills in everything that allows me to build anything my mind can come up with. I enjoy the process of moulding the ideas in my head into something tangible, and then fine tuning it until its exactly what I envisioned. Whether it's the PCBs controlling a new device I want to create, the blender renders for project thumbnails, or even the css files that make up the formatting of this website.
